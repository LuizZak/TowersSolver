/// A solver step that deals with loopy lines that touch a face in a corner in
/// such a way that the line has to traverse through the face, marking a minimal
/// number of edges around the face.
///
/// Ex: On the following grid, the top-right marked edge has to pass through the
/// 1-hinted face to be able to continue. Since we know that it will have to cross
/// the edges of the face, we know the left edge of the cell cannot be marked
/// (since it would exceed the requiremet for the cell), and the right and bottom
/// edges of the face also cannot be marked, since it would require marking the
/// two edges to make the corner, which would exceed the requirement, as well.
